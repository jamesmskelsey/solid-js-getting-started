## What this is

I heard about Solid.js and wanted to play with it. This is what I call a "kitchen sink app". I just use everything.

It doesn't matter if it's good, or if it does anything. This is just how I learn. I play with every aspect of the framework, break it, fix it and so on. I highly recommend the method.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
